# CS355-Search-Engine-Term-Project
A very basic but functional search engine. http://bit.ly/cs355site

## What is this?
This was originally a term class project for my CS355 class. We had to create a search engine that can display hard-coded results, request results from Google (via Google CSE - Custom Search Engine), and from our own database.

The files I committed represent the amount of progress I achieved during the semester. I look forward to adding further improvements over the summer.

Having gained some more experience in web dev, I modified the site a bit. I changed a bit of the look and feel without completely scrapping my previous design. I also improved the javascript file somewhat, mainly to improve user experience, and implement result downloading.
